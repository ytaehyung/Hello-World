# Hello-World
My journey with Github starts today!


Howiya, I'm Teo. I am currently living and working in Dublin, Ireland.
I would like to begin my data science journey here. 
Over the last year, I have studied Data analytics at the National College of Ireland. 

Here in Github, I am going to start a number of data analytics projects.
Thank you for reading.


Cheers,
Teo
